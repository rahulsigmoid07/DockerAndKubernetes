# Docker-Kubernetes-assignment

## Docker Assignment
1. Wrote a python script to create a DAG that has tasks to add execution time to a postgres table. <br\>
* ##### Made docker compose file for airflow containers and postgres database 
2. The DAG ran successfully.

3. Verified the result by viewing the table.

3. To get the above results, follow the below steps:
* Download the folder ```DockerAndKubernetes``` Change directory to get inside this folder.
* Run ``` docker compose up -d ``` to build the required containers.

## Kubernetes Assignment
1. Made a custom docker image for postgres with airflow installed in it. The container made from this image will be used as a database for airflow and also to store dag execution data in a table. The following dockerfile was used for creating the image.python
``` python
# USING LATEST POSTGRES IMAGE
FROM postgres:latest 

# SWITCH TO ROOT USER
USER root

# STEPS TO BUILD PYTHON VERSION 3.7
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get Â -y install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget 
RUN wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.12/Python-3.7.12.tgz
RUN tar -xf Python-3.7.12.tgz
WORKDIR /Python-3.7.12
RUN ./configure --enable-optimizations
RUN make -j $(nproc)
RUN make altinstall

# STEPS TO INSTALL AIRFLOW VERSION 2.5.0
RUN apt-get install libpq-dev
RUN pip3.7 install "apache-airflow[postgres]==2.5.0" --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.5.0/constraints-3.7.txt"2. This image and the custom airflow image were pushed in dockerhub for public access.
```

2. Installed minikube to make a kubernetes cluster using the following commands.
``` bash
brew install minikube
 minikube start 
```

3. Using the ```postgres-deployment.yaml```file the pod containing postgres container was made. The following command was used,
```bash
kubectl apply -f postgres-deployment.yaml
```
4. The postgres container has airflow installed in it. But it was not initialised as the database for airflow. I tried to do it automatically by writing commands in yaml file, but some error always popped up. So, I entered the postgres docker container using,
``` bash
kubectl exec -it your-pod-name -- /bin/bash #Then ran the following command to initialise the database and make a user.bash
export AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN=postgresql://airflow:airflow@localhost:5432/airflow

airflow db init

airflow users create -u airflow -p airflow -f rahul -l kumar -e xyz@gmail.com -r Admin
```
5. Then created a service of type clusterIP by running ```postgres-service.yaml``` to give access to postgres pods inside the cluster. The following command was used.
``` bash
kubectl apply -f postgres-service.yaml
```
6.  Entered the airflow scheduler container as root user using the following commands,
``` bash
minikube ssh #To login inside minikube cluster
docker exec -it -u root your-airflow-scheduler-container-id /bin/bash #To get inside scheduler container
cd /opt/airflow/dags #Changed directory to dags folder

#Installed vim
apt-get update
apt-get install vim
vim postgress_db.py #Made this file and copied my code inside it
```
7. Created a service of type load balancer by running ``` airflow-service.yaml ```to access airflow webserver from my local system using the following command,
 ``` bash
kubectl apply -f airflow-service.yaml
```
8. Accessed the airflow webserver by running the command ```minikube service airflow ```. Upon logging in, the dag was visible and it ran successfully.

9. Verified this by logging into the postgres container and viewing the table.
